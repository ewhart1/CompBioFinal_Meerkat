# compBioFinal_meerkat
Zara, Charis, and Eric's final project for BIOL 4800. Our objective is to run a simulation of a population of meerkats with varying phenotyoes. We have implemented a user input structure that allows the user to determine the starting population size, the number of individuals present in each different phenotype at the start of the simulation, and the number of generations to run. Our graph, which is dependent on the relative reproductive success of each phenotype, will show the user how each phenotype in the population fluctuates throughout the simulation.
